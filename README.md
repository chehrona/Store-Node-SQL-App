# Bamazon-Node-SQL-App

This app unitlizes MySQL database and Node.js to add, retrieve, delete and update tables within the database. 

The customer file allows to see the table with the current items available for sale and their prices. The command line prompts the "customer" to enter 
the ID and the quantity of the item they want to purchase.
